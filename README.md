`golo` is a simple, very much incomplete Go-wrapper around [`liblo`](http://liblo.sourceforge.net/).

Only a small subset of types is supported. Right now those are

* `int32`
* `int64`
* `float32`
* `float64`
* `string`

If you feel the urge to complete this wrapper, nobody is stopping you to do so :) I'll merge your stuff happily.
